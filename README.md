# I Missed You

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds keyboard shortcuts to the **Material Tool** and **ProtoFlux Tool** — just like the Dev Tool has!

## What does this mod do?

If you've ever used the **Dev Tool** in Resonite, you know you can press **I** to open the inspector. This mod brings that same convenience to other tools:

### Material Tool
- Press **I** to open the material editor/gizmo for the material you're currently holding

### ProtoFlux Tool  
- Press **I** to open the node browser
- Press **O** to toggle overview mode

## Configuration

All keybinds are configurable in your mod settings:
- `MaterialToolInspectorKey` - Key to open material editor (default: I)
- `ProtoFluxNodeBrowserKey` - Key to open node browser (default: I)
- `ProtoFluxOverviewKey` - Key to toggle overview mode (default: O)

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [IMissedYou.dll](https://github.com/nalathethird/I-missed-you/releases/latest/download/IMissedYou.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
